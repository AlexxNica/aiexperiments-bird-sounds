## Bird Sounds
Thousands of bird sounds, visualized using machine learning.

## About

Bird sounds vary widely. This experiment uses machine learning to organize thousands of bird sounds. The computer wasn’t given tags or the birds’ names – only the audio. Using a technique called t-SNE, the computer created this map, where similar sounds are placed closer together.
